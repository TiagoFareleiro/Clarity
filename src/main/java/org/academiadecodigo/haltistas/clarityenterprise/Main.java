/*
Systemthat provides live information of your company at any point in time and compares and possibly predicts solutions.

a system that all departments not only exist phisicaly but also virtually. this means that all staff abd their
respective deparment will be shown and their stats as well.

this system will be provided for customer services and can be adpated to any other company that has interection with their
customers over the phone or emails.

scenario:
call comes in the call centre asking for information about a case that its still pending.
the customer services representative now will need to issue a ticket and than he will come back to the customer after a
couple of hours but probably days.

With Clarity we pretend to cut this communication problem and resolve comunincation issues within the comapany.

a normal process od disputes tend to take 1 to 2 weeks for a reply. this usually takes beucase of communcation issues
within the company.

with clairty the customer service representative takes the call and by the customer request the CSR can now alocate the person
in charge of the case by acessing the correct department and searcjing by a ID number that the customer provides.
calrity will show the percentage of resolution and will predict how long may tame withing the schedule provided to the customer


with type of percentage we can evaluate the departments eficiency and if something is going wrong theere is no need to wait.
for the first time we might a system that is not only reactible but can make pro eficient.
